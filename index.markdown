<div markdown="1" class="text_section">
The EAR Production Suite (EPS) is a set of VST® plugins for digital audio workstations (DAWs) that enable sound engineers to produce immersive and personalizable content using the [Audio Definition Model](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2076) (ADM) format and to monitor it for any [ITU-R BS.2051](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2051/en) loudspeaker configuration using the [ITU ADM Renderer](https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-BS.2127/en). ADM is the only format available for codec-agnostic [Next Generation Audio](https://tech.ebu.ch/nga) (NGA) productions. Moreover, the EAR Production Suite enables professionals to import and export ADM files, compliant to the [EBU ADM Production profile](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3392.pdf). The VST® plugins are currently optimized for the Reaper DAW, which features an extension interface that is used to import and export ADM files within a BW64 container. The EAR Production Suite was designed to demonstrate the intended use of the ADM in audio production workflows, so that the standards can be adopted in other professional tools in a consistent manner.

The EAR Production Suite is a joint development of [BBC R&D](https://bbc.co.uk/rd) and [IRT](https://www.irt.de/en/home)
